Table: reading_sessions

+----------------+---------+
| Column Name    | Type    |
+----------------+---------+
| session_id     | int     |
| book_id        | int     |
| reader_name    | varchar |
| pages_read     | int     |
| session_rating | int     |
+----------------+---------+
session_id is the unique ID for this table.
Each row represents a reading session where someone read a portion of a book. session_rating is on a scale of 1-5.
Write a solution to find books that have polarized opinions - books that receive both very high ratings and very low ratings from different readers.

A book has polarized opinions if it has at least one rating ≥ 4 and at least one rating ≤ 2
Only consider books that have at least 5 reading sessions
Calculate the rating spread as (highest_rating - lowest_rating)
Calculate the polarization score as the number of extreme ratings (ratings ≤ 2 or ≥ 4) divided by total sessions
Only include books where polarization score ≥ 0.6 (at least 60% extreme ratings)
Return the result table ordered by polarization score in descending order, then by title in descending order.

The result format is in the following example.
